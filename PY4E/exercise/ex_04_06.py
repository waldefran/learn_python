'''
4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours 
worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and
 use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 
 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and 
 float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless 
 you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your sum variable or use 
 the sum() function.
